import {Http, Headers, RequestOptionsArgs} from 'angular2/http';
import {Subject, Observable} from 'rxjs'
import {Injectable} from 'angular2/core';

// idea is to make a layer on top of Http which is transparent to the user but comes with this additional features:
// - connection tracking
//      observable keeps track of its connection status. if one call fails (timesout or host unreachable) it will mark connection as down
//      and will not try to make another call until connection is back up or ping_delay ms pass
//      it can also do periodic checks on connection (if ping_url is provided)
//  - exposes connection status
//  - guarantees that request will be executed once the connection is back (in case its down)
//  - exposes the list of requests in progress and allows setting the list
//      which allows us to store its state in localStorage and then restore it next time application loads
//
// this way the consumer should have less problems writting application that will also work offline
// when user goes temporary offline, he would continue to use the application
// application would notify him about the offline status (binding to the getStatus() of this service)
// some UI features could also be disabled based on this status
//
// when he would normally execute http.get and get an error, here he would be sure that once connection is back his data will be updated
// he would still get error notification, when he could inform the user that the data he is seeing could not be up to date due to offline status
//
// this comes to full power with update put and delete request. we can work offline, creating new entries (lets say in our ToDo app)
// when we come back online all data will be sent to the server in the same order as we did the actions.
//
// we can provide the user with information about how many requests are still pending and for example when he tries to leave the pge
// we could notify him about pending requests and offer him an option to save them and send them later, or discard them
